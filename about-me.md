## Projects I've done

### Sport Chrono

This project started out with the goal of streaming live results during sports events, which quickly led us to adopt Node.js
with its powerful event-driven mantra. Extremely satisfied with the results, this would soon become the core of the entire
registration and timing platform.

## Open source

I have collaborated on some cool open source projects including express-restify-mongoose, stripe-chainable, cloudcp, bootstrap-horizon and a few more.

All of them are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~zertz).
