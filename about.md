I studied in electrical engineering in college, where I learned quite a few things I can't remember today. I am currently based in Magog,
a small-ish city east of Montreal with plenty of beautiful roads to ride that sweet cyclocross. Quite tall, mostly self-taught, always
thriving to learn, probably listening to music and usually available for a drink. Open to remote work and will consider moving for an
awesome opportunity.

- The MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node

## Projects I've worked on recently

### Sport Chrono

This project started out with the goal of streaming live results during sports events, which quickly led us to adopt Node.js with its
powerful event-driven mantra. Extremely satisfied with the results, this would soon become the core of the entire registration and timing
platform.

### FluidApps

The relationship I developed with Sport Chrono and the experience I gained led us to found FluidApps, where I developed a web app for
non-profits.

## Open source

I have collaborated on some cool open source projects including express-restify-mongoose, stripe-chainable, cloudcp, bootstrap-horizon and
a few more.

All of them are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~zertz).
