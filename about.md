I studied in electrical engineering in college, where I learned quite a few things I can't remember today. I am currently based in Magog,
a smallish town east of Montreal with plenty of beautiful roads to ride that sweet cyclocross. Quite tall, mostly self-taught, always
thriving to learn, probably listening to music and usually available for a drink. Open to remote work and will consider moving for an
awesome opportunity.

## Projects I've worked on recently

### Sport Chrono

Developer tasked of building and improving an existing set of race timing software composed of a C# .NET desktop application and a web
platform hacked on top of a mix of WordPress and vanilla PHP. I migrated customer-facing features over to a modern and scalable stack. I
put together a development workflow using version control and continuous integration, updating the platform in stages, allowing for quick
deployments.

### FluidApps

Initially the sole developer, I designed and architected a platform for non-profits to raise money through a crowdfunding application, an
administrative dashboard and the automation of tedious tasks such as generating donation receipts and financial reports. With the
platformâ€™s well established core foundation, our customers were able to successfully reach and often exceed their objective.

## Open source and community

As a core contributor to express-restify-mongoose, I have learned much from refactoring it from its initial state as a monolithic project
to a modular and well tested framework. Since my first contributions, it has grown from about 175 stars to over 325. I also maintain a few
modules, including stripe-history, cloudcp, ng-range-filter and bootstrap-horizon. I have also had the opportunity to attend
NodeInteractive 2015, which was a fantastic event organized by the newly formed Node.js Foundation.

All of them are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~zertz).
